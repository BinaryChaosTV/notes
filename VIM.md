# Using Vim
## Installation
If you're using a debian-based Distro, you can install Vim by using the following command in a terminal prompt:

	sudo apt install vim

## Add-ons for Vim
If you're going to use Vim, I highly recommend you install [Tim Pope's Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) first, as it makes it much easier to implement Add-ons in different directories.

Next, for theme colours (which don't always work out of the box in the terminal), I highly recommend [Ethan Shoover's Solarized for VIM](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized).
