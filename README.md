# Personal Notes

A collection of notes, sharing my daily thoughts, or sharing instructions or documentation about software I use for my PC at home and work. I'm creating this as it's sometimes difficult to remember how to configure some applications when I haven't done it in a while...And sometimes the documentation on these applications are horrendous.
